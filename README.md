# Tests for MX481

## Setup

Before a test of the MX481 router can be run, it must first be configured correctly. This requires a sample configuration file as referenced in the problem statement. 

The configuration file should include all necessary commands needed to establish proper connectivity on the router. This includes the following: 

- Enable the router with an IP address. 
- Define the routing protocols.
- Define IP subnets.
- Enable access lists.
- Configure gateway IPs.

## Execution

Once the MX481 has been configured properly, the test can be initiated. To ensure that the appropriate data is collected during the test, it is important that the router be configured with a breakpoint. The breakpoint should be set at a specific point in the configuration so that the data can be observed and collected in its entirety. 

To begin the test, enter the breakpoint command. This command should be followed by the “execute” command, which will start the test.

## Verification

Once the test has been initiated, the data gathered needs to be verified to ensure that the expected results have been achieved. To do this, the output of the test should be observed and evaluated carefully.

If the output matches the expectations, then the test is successful. If the output does not match the expectations, then the test has failed.

## Teardown

Once the test has finished and the results have been verified, the breakpoint should be cleared. This can be done by entering the breakpoint clear command.

## User Stories

As a network engineer, I want to verify the configuration of the MX481 router by running a detailed test. 

I want to set a breakpoint in the router so that I can observe and collect the data coming through while I run the test. 

I want to be able to execute the test by entering the appropriate commands. 

I want to verify the output by comparing it to the expected results of the test. 

I want to then clear the breakpoint so that I can finish the test and proceed with other operations.
